# MinishellTestScript v0.1
(WIP) Minishell testing script, written in shell

- Ensure that BASH is installed
- Ensure that the executable is named "minishell"
- Place test.sh and cases.txt in the same folder as the minishell executable
- Edit cases.txt conform your needs

**IMPORTANT: LEAVE A BLANK LINE AT THE BOTTOM IN YOUR CASES FILE**

Run test.sh:
The script runs every line in cases.txt with both minishell and bash, compares the output and returns OK/KO depending on whether they are **exactly** equal.
